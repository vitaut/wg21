# Introduction

We need to deprecate a rare usage of `_` as an identifier in C++20 so it can
be safely used for pattern matching [@P1371] which is targeting C++23. The
issue is simple, we'd like structured binding code as in,

```c++
auto [a, _] = std::make_pair(3, 4);
```

to have `_` represent a wildcard pattern instead of binding the identifier
`_`. There are a few ways to do this and we suggest what we think is the ideal
engineering approach.

# Various Approaches

## Use something besides `_` (BAD)

Why is `_` so important when `?` is available? Languages with pattern
matching almost universally use `_` as a wildcard pattern and popular libraries
in C++ (like Google Test) do the same. It would be awkward and somewhat
embarrassing if C++ were to not use such a ubiquitous token. Furthermore, because
`_` has so much existing widespread use, we expect people to use `_` anyway,
and accidentally bind the `_` identifier.

`__` is another possiblility, but it is difficult to recognize as a double
underscore with many fonts and we expect significant confusion were we to use
this.

## Deprecate all or most uses of `_` as an identifier (WORSE)

Another option is to deprecate all or most uses of `_` as an identifier. We could,
for instance, deprecate references to `_` identifiers declared in block-scope.
The migration cost for this is unfortunately quite a steep one. There are more
instances of the `_` token than `short` in the wild according to [@ACTCD16].
Breaking all this code would be extremely costly for the C++ community.

## Deprecate `_` access when structured-binding bound (OKAY)

Finally, we could deprecate referencing `_` identifiers that are bound as
part of a structured binding. Because structured binding is a relatively new
feature and most uses of `_` as a structured binding identifier are expected to
be wildcard uses anyway, the cost of fixing breakages would be low.
This change to be a sweet spot for engineering value, but we need to act
quickly if we want to take advantage of this for pattern matching in C++23.

## Disallow `_` access when structured-binding bound (GOOD)

Because usages of `_` identifiers that are bound by structured binding are so
rare, there is little engineering benefit in deprecating these usages instead
of just making access illegal altogether. In fact, a deprecation period can
actually increase cost as engineers (who ignore warnings) will have more
opportunity to use `_` identifiers bound by structured bindings.

# Should we generalize this as in P1110R0?

[@P1110R0] suggests that we make something like the wildcard (`_`) pattern
accessible in many other places than patterns (e.g. in an enumerator). The
authors of this paper find questionable engineering value for many of these
suggestions and have no opinion on others. Our primary focus is on parity
between structured bindings and pattern matching.

# Wording

Change in 7.5.4.1 [expr.prim.id.unqual] paragraph 2:

> The result is the entity denoted by the identifier. [Use of the *identifier*
> `_` to denote a structured binding is deprecated.]{.add} If the entity is a
> local entity...

Change in 7.5.5.2 [expr.prim.lambda.capture] paragraph 4:

> The *identifier* in a *simple-capture* is looked up using the usual rules for
> unqualified name lookup (6.4.1); each such lookup shall find a local entity.
> [Use of the *identifier* `_` in a *simple-capture* is deprecated if the
> identifier denotes a structured binding.]{.add} The *simple-captures* `this`
> and `* this` denote...

Insert a new subclause before D.2 [depr.capture.this]:

:::add
>
> **D.2 Use of _ as a structured binding [depr.uscore]**
>
> The ability to refer to a structured binding named `_` is deprecated (7.5.4.1
> [expr.prim.id.unqual], 7.5.5.2 [expr.prim.lambda.capture]). [Example:
>
> | `void f() {`
> |   `int a[] = {2005, 7, 14};`
> |   `auto [x, _, z] = a;  // ok`
> |   `int y = _;           // deprecated, reference to _`
> |   `[_](){};             // deprecated, capture of _`
> | `}`
>
> -- end example]
:::


# Conclusion

Right now we have an opportunity to prevent mistakes being made by using the
wildcard that everyone expects for pattern matching. Let's deprecate or disallow
access to `_` variables if they are bound by structured binding.
