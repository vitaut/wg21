# Introduction

This paper is inspired by [@N3655], section 3 of which was adopted at WG21's
2013 Bristol meeting. That section provided (as did its predecessor [@N3546])
template aliases for the result of _metafunctions_ in `<type_traits>`.
However, the broader question of analogous template aliases throughout
the remainder of the standard library was not addressed.

This paper recommends a systematic guideline to steer future WG21 decisions
in deciding when a _metafunction-name_\_**t** template alias should accompany
a standard library _metafunction_. After applying this recommended guideline
to the entire C++14 standard library, we conclude that `tuple_element_t`
is the only missing alias. We then propose wording (a) to remedy this lack
and (b) to take advantage of the proposed remedy. Finally, we also present
an alternative guideline and its implications, and provide justifications
for favoring the recommended guideline.

# Motivation and Scope

[@N3655] provided the motivation for the existence of the `_t` template
aliases. The goal of this paper is to introduce a guideline for WG21 to
systematically decide when a _metafunction_ in the standard library should be
accompanied by a _metafunction-name_\_**t** template alias. Specifically,
we want to ensure that future standard library _metafunctions_ stay consistent
with those we currently have.

The proposed guideline is the following:

> A class template should be accompanied by a _metafunction-name_\_**t**
> template alias if it provides a public member `type` named type and no
> other accessible members.

An exhaustive search through the text of [@N3797] reveals that the only
class templates that meet the above guideline are the following:

  - _TransformationTraits_ from section 3 of [@N3655].
  - `tuple_element`

Since `tuple_element_t` is the only missing template alias, we propose to add it.

# Impact on the Standard

This proposal is a pure library extension. It does not require any new language
features, it is merely an extension of an existing practice adopted from
[@N3655].

# Proposed Wording

Add to `<tuple>` synopsis of [@N3797]:

```diff
// 20.4.2.5: tuple helper classes:
+template <size_t I, class T>
+using tuple_element_t = typename tuple_element <I, T>::type;
```

The definition of `get` functions in __§20.3.4__, and __§20.4.2.6__ of
[@N3797] can be simplified as follows[^1]:

```diff
// 20.3.4: tuple-like access to pair:
template <size_t I, class T1, class T2>
-  constexpr typename tuple_element<I, std::pair<T1, T2> >::type&
+  constexpr tuple_element_t<I, pair<T1, T2> >&
-    get(std::pair<T1, T2>&) noexcept;
+    get(pair<T1, T2>&) noexcept;

template <size_t I, class T1, class T2>
-  constexpr typename tuple_element<I, std::pair<T1, T2> >::type&&
+  constexpr tuple_element_t<I, pair<T1, T2> >&&
-    get(std::pair<T1, T2>&&) noexcept;
+    get(pair<T1, T2>&&) noexcept;

template <size_t I, class T1, class T2>
-  constexpr const typename tuple_element<I, std::pair<T1, T2> >::type&
+  constexpr const tuple_element_t<I, pair<T1, T2> >&
-    get(const std::pair<T1, T2>&) noexcept;
+    get(const pair<T1, T2>&) noexcept;

// 20.4.2.6, element access :
template <size_t I, class ... Types>
-  constexpr typename tuple_element<I, tuple<Types...> >::type&
+  constexpr tuple_element_t<I, tuple<Types...> >&
    get(tuple<Types...>&) noexcept;

template <size_t I, class ... Types>
-  constexpr typename tuple_element<I, tuple<Types...> >::type&&
+  constexpr tuple_element_t<I, tuple<Types...> >&&
    get(tuple<Types...>&&) noexcept;

template <size_t I, class ... Types>
-  constexpr typename tuple_element<I, tuple<Types...> >::type const&
+  constexpr const tuple_element_t<I, tuple<Types...> >&
    get(const tuple<Types...>&) noexcept;
```

[^1]: Note the removal of explicit `std::` namespace qualifiers and
      a standardized placement of `const` as a drive-by-fix.

# Design Decisions

We considered an alternative guideline:

> A class template should be accompanied by a _metafunction-name_\_**t**
> template alias if it provides a public member type named `type` and
> possibly other accessible members.

An exhaustive search through the text of [@N3797] reveals that the class
templates that meet this alternative guideline are the following:

  - `integral_constant`
    - _TransformationTraits_ from section 4 of [@N3655]
    - `is_bind_expression`
    - `is_error_code_enum`
    - `is_error_condition_enum`
    - `is_placeholder`
    - `ratio_equal`
    - `ratio_greater`
    - `ratio_greater_equal`
    - `ratio_less`
    - `ratio_less_equal`
    - `ratio_not_equal`
    - `tuple_size`
    - `uses_allocator`
  - `ratio`
  - `ratio_add`
  - `ratio_divide`
  - `ratio_multiply`
  - `ratio_subtract`
  - `reference_wrapper`

This guideline is overly accepting, because we are rarely interested in
the `type` member of these class templates. Consider `integral_constant`
along with all of the class templates listed under it which inherit from
`integral_constant`. The class member we are far more interested in for these
class templates is the `value` member. For `ratio`, and __ratio__\_*operations*,
the `type` member is simply a type alias for itself, and `reference_wrapper`’s
`type` member is nothing but an identity type alias for `T`.

Also consider their intended use cases. All of __is__\_*property*,
__ratio__\_*compare*, and `uses_allocator` are intended for compile-time boolean
tests. `tuple_size` is intended to acquire the size of a `tuple`.
`integral_constant` is intended to capture a compile-time value and is sometimes
used for tagged dispatch. __ratio__\_*operations* are used for compile-time
rational arithmetic. `reference_wrapper` is simply intended for containing
references in our containers. The intended use cases make it clear that these
are not _metafunctions_ that yield a type as a result.

On the contrary, the proposed guideline captures the correct intended use of
the class templates. If the only member provided for a class template is `type`,
it is most likely a _metafunction_ which yields a type as a result. This
categorization holds true for all of _TransformationTraits_ from section 3 of
[@N3655] and `tuple_element`. For example, `add_const` is a _metafunction_
which yields a `const`-qualified version of the type as a result, and
`tuple_element` is a _metafunction_ which yields the type that lies at
a specified index within a list of types as a result. Therefore providing
a template alias for such class templates will be useful for convenient access
to the `type` member.
